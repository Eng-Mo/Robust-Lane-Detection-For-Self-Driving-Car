    "The project aim is detecting Lane line in road regardless the color of the lane as it differ from country to other. Also the proposed work addressed to enhance the frame against the light reflection. Many techniques in Image Processing enhancement has conducted such as analyze the histogram equalization for HLS space and norm the histogram. However , in some frames the amount of light was strong. HLS color space has chosen because it has the ability to analyze the image color against the amount of Light. Other method was investigated but not conducted (shape from shadow , the gradient of the image)as the shadow reflect arbitrary shape and the following are the followed pipeline:\n",

    "This solution detect the lane in each frame in the challenging video except 4 frames. By decreasing the Hough votes it can detect the lane in each frame but other small lines will be detected in area that has high shadow noise. Also the drawn lines are shaking depend on the location of the Lane in each frame. The performance of the system might be influenced by other lighting condition\n",

    "This algorithm can be improved by enhance the histogram either in dark side or bright side. as by decrease the bright range to be in darker side and increase the dark range to brighter rage so that the two histogram peaks be aligned in same histogram range. but I find difficulty to modify part of histogram to another range."
